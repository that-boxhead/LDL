CNNs

Multiple cascaded convolutional layers

Max Pooling

Reduce the resolution so channel size reduces for further operations

Yields an output with the same number of channels as the input, as opposed to convolutional layers which can define their own number of channels

Have to pad edges of image so as not to lose resolution

***

Because CNNs share weights in a channel and have sparse connections to the previous layer, they are less resource intensive compared to fully-connected layers
