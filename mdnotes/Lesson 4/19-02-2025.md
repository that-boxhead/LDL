# CNNs

Properties of CNNs

- An individual channel shares weights
- Convolutional layer is sparsely connected to previous layer/input layer
- These imply "translational invariance"

"Affine transformation" - change location/orientation without changing shape

"Convolutional layer is not rotation invariant" - so not invariant to all affine transformations
