# Perceptron

Weighted sum of a vector of inputs.

Output passes through a "sign" function.

Returns +1 if the sum is positive, -1 if negative.

Perceptron has a bias input of contant value 1. This also has a learned weight.

***

Perceptron output $y$ is given as

$$
y = f(z)
$$

$$
z = \sum_{i=0}^n w_i x_i
$$

For the sign function:

$$

f(z) = \begin{cases}

-1 & z < 1 \\
1 & z \geq 1

\end{cases}

$$

and the bias weight:

$x_0 = 1$

***

Perceptron training based on output sensitivity to weight changes.

Require a "ground truth" - supervised learning.
